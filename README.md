# Wunderground-Web-Scarping
A python code for the web scraping of the Weather Underground (wunderground) website 

In this code, we are going to perform a web scraping of the wunderground website to obtain the 
monthly weather data of any city in the world.

Here, we present an example for Barcelona, Spain for the month of April, 2020

We implement the code in Python using Selenium.

The output is a csv file, containing the weather data of your chosen city.
